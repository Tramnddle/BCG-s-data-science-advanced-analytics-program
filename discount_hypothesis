Objective
To evaluate the revenue impact of a strategy where a 20% discount is offered to high-risk-of-churn customers, and to determine the optimal churn probability threshold (cut-off) for offering this discount to maximize revenue.

Methodology
Baseline Revenue Calculation (No Discount)

Forecast revenue is calculated from forecast electricity consumption, price, and meter rent.

For churned customers, revenue is reduced by 91.9% to reflect partial-year retention.

Intervention Strategy (With Discount)

Customers above a chosen churn probability threshold receive a 20% discount.

Assumptions:

All customers offered a discount accept it.

Discounted customers are fully retained.

Non-discounted customers churn based on actual outcomes.

Revenue Delta Calculation

The difference between revenue with and without the discount strategy is calculated for different thresholds to find the optimal cut-off.

Key Findings
Optimal Cut-off Point (Simple Strategy):

At a churn probability threshold of 0.30, the maximum revenue delta is $53,985.16.

Value-Based Strategy (High Revenue Customers Only):

Limits discount to customers with base revenue > $500.

Less effective: max delta $27,207.70 at cut-off 0.29.

Probability-Based Churn Forecast Strategy:

Uses predicted churn probabilities instead of actual churn outcomes.

Best result: $77,390.85 at cut-off 0.22.

Model Calibration:

Calibration of predicted probabilities is acceptable; no major correction applied.

Insights & Recommendations
A 20% discount can effectively retain revenue, especially if applied strategically.

Churn probability alone isnâ€™t sufficient; revenue value of customers should also be considered.

Future improvements may include:

Optimizing both discount level and cut-off threshold (2D optimization).

Modeling churn likelihood as a function of discount level to better predict customer response.
